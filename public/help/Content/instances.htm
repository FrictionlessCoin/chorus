        <h1>Instances</h1>
        <p>The Instances page allows you to explore and edit the major areas associated with instances.  The following topic presents a list of features that best describe the information you can access and tasks you can perform from this page.</p>
        <h3>Features of the Instances page</h3>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Exploring instances</li>
            <li value="2">Administering an instance</li>
            <li value="3">Working with instances</li>
            <li value="4">Viewing associated workspaces</li>
            <li value="5">Exploring data</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Exploring instances</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Browse the list displayed in the left pane. You will see instances grouped under <b>Registered Greenplum Instances</b>, <b>Registered Hadoop Instances</b>, and <b>Other Instances</b>.</li>
            <li value="2">Highlight an instance to view information about it in the right pane. <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li value="1">For Greenplum Database instances, if you are a Chorus administrator or instance owner, you can <b>Edit</b>instance permissions, <b>Edit Instance</b>, <b>View Workspaces</b>, and <b>Add a note</b>. You can <b>Comment</b> on the activity, and <b>Promote to Insight</b>. For Hadoop instances </li><li value="2">If you are a User you can <b>Edit Credentials</b>, <b>Remove Credentials</b>,<b>View Workspaces</b>, and <b>Add a note</b>. You can <b>Comment</b> on the activity, and <b>Promote to Insight</b>.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Administering an instance</h2>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Setting/editing permissions</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="noteindent">Note that the following information about setting/editing permissions only applies to Greenplum Database instances, not Hadoop instances.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Edit</b>: Select this option from the Instances page to open the <b>Instance Permissions</b> dialog. If you are a Chorus administrator or the instance owner, you can change the instance permissions  here to be either a <b>Shared single account</b>, or an <b>Individual account</b>.<ul><li value="1"> In <i>shared account</i> mode, Chorus will use this single Greenplum Database username and password for all Chorus users. This account should have the lowest level of permissions available. This account is also used by Chorus to index the instance for search. In shared mode, only Administrators and instance owners can edit this credential. </li><li value="2">In <i>Individual account</i> mode, each Chorus user must provide their own username and password for Chorus to use to connect to the Greenplum Database instance. The instance owner's account will be used by Chorus to index the instance for search. In this mode, Chorus users can add/edit/remove their own credentials to the instance.<br /></li></ul></li>
            <li value="2"><b>Add Account</b>: Select this option to grant a user permissions to the instance. Select the user from the drop down list and provide your username and password. Note that this functionality is only available if you are in Individual Account mode.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Edit</b>: Select this option from within the Instance Permissions change the user name and password that are used to connect to the instance.</li>
            <li value="4"><b>Owner</b>: Select this option to transfer ownership of the instance to another user. If you are in Shared Account Mode, you can transfer ownership to any Chorus user. If you are in Individual Account mode, you can only transfer ownership to members who have their account mapping for the instance added.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Configuring the instance</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Edit Instance</b>: Select this option from the Instances page to make configuration changes such as instance name, description, host and ports.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Working with instances</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Click <b>Add Instance</b> on the Instances page to open the Create New Instance dialog. You can select one of the following:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li value="1"><b>Register an existing Greenplum Database instance</b>.</li><li value="2"><b>Create a new Greenplum Database instance</b>. <ul><li value="1">A self-contained Greenplum instance can quickly be provisioned on the Chorus Virtualization Service. You need to specify an account and password to this instance that will be used as a shared account with super-user privileges. When you create a new instance on Chorus Virtualization Service, you can also specify the instance size and select an appropriate resource allocation template (vCPU and memory) for it. </li></ul></li><li value="3"><b>Register an existing Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</b>. Selecting this option allows you to browse the file server for certain text files. You can create an external table to the file using the Greenplum connector, <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">gphdfs</span>, on a workspace's sandbox schema. You will need to specify the data types and the file delimiter so that you can create an external table for it.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="2"><b>Add/Edit Credentials</b>: This opens the     <b>Add/Edit Instance Credentials</b> dialog. Enter the username and password to access the instance. This option is only visible for non-administrative users who are also not the instance owner for a Greenplum Database that is in Individual account mode.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Remove Credentials</b>: Allows you to removes your credentials from Chorus. This option is only visible for non-administrative users who are also not the instance owner for a Greenplum Database that is in Individual account mode. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Viewing Workspaces</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The <b>View Workspaces</b> link displays the number of workspaces with sandboxes on this instance. Clicking this link opens the <b>Chorus Usage by Workspace</b> dialog. This dialog displays information about how much disk space the sandbox schemas are using and if the space used exceeds the recommended disk space for a sandbox schema.  The recommended disk space can be configured by the Chorus Administrator. See the <i>Chorus Installation Guide</i> for details.</li>
            <li value="2">The <b>Add a note</b> link provides you with the option to comment on a particular instance. You have the option to add a desktop file to support your note. You can send the note as a notification to any Chorus user. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Exploring Data</h2>
        <p>You can explore the data on an instance that you have registered by clicking on the instance on the Instance page. </p>
        <p><i>Hadoop</i>: When you click on a Hadoop instance, its files and directories are displayed. The following actions are then available: drilling down into directories, previewing files, adding notes to files, creating external tables to a file on a selected workspace's sandbox, and if the workspace's sandbox instance is Greenplum Database version 4.2 or above, you can specify a directory or set of files in a directory as an external table on the selected workspace's sandbox.</p>
        <p><i>Greenplum</i>: When you click on a Greenplum Database instance, the databases and schemas under it are displayed. The following actions are then available: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Adding a note. A note can be added to the table/view in a schema. You can support your note with attachments from the desktop only. You can send a notification to other Chorus users about the note.</li>
            <li value="2">Attaching table(s)/view(s) to a workspace. You can attach a table/view to a workspace by selecting the table and clicking on <b>Associate dataset with a workspace</b> in the right pane. To attach multiple tables/views, check the box on the table to the left of the table name and click on <b>Associate with a workspace</b> in the right pane.</li>
            <li value="3">Previewing data. You can preview a table's content and data by clicking on the <b>Preview Data</b> option. This queries the table and returns the first 100 rows in a table. You also have the option to download to your desktop a specific number of rows, or to download all the rows.</li>
            <li value="4">Visualizing data. You can create a visual representation of your data by clicking on a table, then specifying <b>Visualize</b>. You can also add data filters. The types of charts you can use to visualize your data are as follows:<ul><li class="bullet2" value="1">Frequency chart</li><li class="bullet2" value="2">Histogram (currently only supports numerical data)</li><li class="bullet2" value="3">Heatmap  (currently only supports numerical data)</li><li class="bullet2" value="4">Time Series</li><li class="bullet2" value="5">Boxplot</li></ul></li>
            <li value="5">Running Analyze. You can click <b>Run analyze</b> to collect statistics about the contents of a table. The results of this analyze are stored in the system table <code>pg_statistic</code>. The query planner will subsequently use these statistics to help determine the most efficient execution plans for queries. These statistics, including row count, common values, and so on, can be viewed from the <b>Information</b> sub-tab for the table. Note: Running analyze on large tables can significantly slow down queries, so should be used with caution.</li>
