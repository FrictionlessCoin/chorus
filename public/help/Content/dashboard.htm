        <p>The following list describes the information you can access and tasks you can perform from this page.</p>
        <h3>Features of the Home page</h3>

Use the links at the top right to filter the Recent Activity pane to show only <b>Insights</b>, or <b>All Activity</b>. You and other users can add comments to an insight, and publish the insight to Chorus to make it visible to all Chorus users.

            <li value="2"><b>Other activities</b>: Other activities can be Notes, Edits, Imports, Associations, and so on. If you own the workspace, you can promote note to an insight, if you are an administrator, you can promote other users' note to insights.</li>
