# requests. The # of worker threads determines the maximum number of

# simultaneously.

# database, thus the sum of 'worker_threads' + 'webserver_threads' must be less
# than the 'max_connections' configured in postgresql.conf.

# kernel shared memory size. For example, on OS X this parameter will default
# to 20.  You can also set the number of database threads per process here with
