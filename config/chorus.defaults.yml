# Configure thread pool size of webserver and worker processes.
#
# The # of webserver threads determines the maximum number of simultaneous web
# requests. The # of worker threads determines the maximum number of
# asychronous jobs, such as table copying or importing, that can be run
# simultaneously.
#
# Each web or worker thread may use its own connection to the local Postgresql
# database, thus the sum of 'worker_threads' + 'webserver_threads' must be less
# than the 'max_connections' configured in postgresql.conf.
#
# The 'max_connections' parameter may be based on your operating system's kernel
# shared memory size. For example, on OS X this parameter will default to 20.
