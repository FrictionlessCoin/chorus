Register on the Greenplum website to download the Greenplum Database and Greenplum Hadoop tar distribution.

Place these files in the /chorus_appliance directory:

greenplum-db-4.2.2.4.tar.gz (the tarred directory greenplum-db-4.2.2.4 after running the greenplum installer)
hadoop-0.20.205.0-gphd-1.1.0.0.tar.gz (from the gphd 1.2 tar distribution)

This will also need a Centos 5.6 minimal vagrant base box called 'centos56'.
